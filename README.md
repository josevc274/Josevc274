🧪 **Self-taught developer** focused on hands-on projects and continuous improvement.  
🧠 Previously worked on:
- Automating contact forms with SendGrid
- Deploying personal and CRUD apps with GitHub Pages
- Full lifecycle: planning → coding → deploying

## 🧠 Previous Experience

Before transitioning into web development, I gained valuable experience in various fields that helped shape my adaptability, problem-solving mindset, and attention to detail:

- **Retail Store Manager (Panama):**  
  Managed daily operations of three food retail stores, leading teams and ensuring high customer satisfaction.

- **Entrepreneur (Argentina):**  
  Founded and ran a local supermarket business, handling logistics, inventory, and customer service.

- **Photoshop Template Designer:**  
  Created professional PSD templates from scratch for digital products and client use.

  Supported legal teams by filling out USCIS immigration forms with high accuracy and confidentiality.

These roles taught me how to lead, work under pressure, and continuously learn — skills I now apply in my journey as a web developer.
